</define>

Procedure
---------

1.  **Determine Task:**

    1.  Set <instruction><getopt-arguments/></instruction> initially, with any
        leading and trailing whitespace stripped, and set <temp-dir></temp-dir>
        (empty). Inherit the always existing <ase-task-id/> from the current
        context. Inherit the always existing <ase-session-id/> from the
        current context. Do not output anything.

    2.  React on task id:

        <expand name="task-react-id" arg1="ase-task-integrate"></expand>

    3.  Resolve the draft shorthand: if <getopt-option-draft/> is `true`
        and <getopt-option-changeset/> is not empty, only output the
        following <template/> and then immediately *STOP* processing the
        entire current skill:

        <template>
        ⧉ **ASE**: ◉ task: **<ase-task-id/>**, ▶ ERROR: options `--draft` and `--changeset` are mutually exclusive
        </template>

        Otherwise, if <getopt-option-draft/> is `true`, set
        <getopt-option-changeset>attachment:draft</getopt-option-changeset>,
        so the *implementation draft* in the attachment `draft` of the
        plan is delivered. Do not output anything.

2.  **Determine Operation:**

    1.  Determine the current task plan content:

        <expand name="task-load-content"></expand>

    2.  If the <task-content/> is still empty, complain and tell the user to
        use the `ase-code-resolve`, `ase-code-refactor`, `ase-code-craft`,
        or `ase-task-edit` skills first to create a task plan, and
        `ase-task-implement` to create its change set. Then immediately
        stop processing this skill.

    3.  <if condition="<getopt-option-stateless/> is not equal `true`, the task lifecycle model <ase-project-task-lifecycle/> is `solo`, and the `Status:` frontmatter key of <task-content/> is present and not equal `OPEN`">
        Only an `OPEN` plan can be integrated in the `solo` model, as
        only `OPEN` transitions directly into `CLOSED`. Set <status/> to
        the value of this key. Only output the
        following <template/>, directly followed by the hint, and then
        immediately *STOP* processing the entire current skill, leaving
        the plan and the artifacts *untouched*:

        <template>
        ⧉ **ASE**: ◉ task: **<ase-task-id/>**, ▶ ERROR: plan with status **<status/>** cannot be integrated (expected **OPEN**)
        </template>

        <ase-tpl-hint level="minimal">
        Run `/ase-task-status OPEN` first to re-open the plan.
        </ase-tpl-hint>
        </if>

3.  **Prepare Changeset and Target:**

    The *changeset* (location of the change set) and the *target*
    (place of integration) are controlled by the `Changeset:` and
    `Target:` frontmatter keys of the plan, which the `--changeset` and
    `--target` options override *ad-hoc* without changing the plan.
    The `worktree` value of the changeset refers to the *context
    worktree*, selected by the `--worktree` option, the `worktree` value
    of the target (and of the source it may refer to) to the *origin
    working copy* the skill was started in (both are the same without
    `--worktree`). An integration never creates a context worktree.

    1.  Set <task-changeset/> to <getopt-option-changeset/> if it is not
        empty, otherwise to the value of the `Changeset:` frontmatter key
        of <task-content/>, or to the configured default
        <ase-project-task-default-changeset/> if the key is absent, and
        parse it:

        <expand name="changeset-value"
            arg1="Changeset"
            arg2="<task-changeset/>"
            arg3="`worktree`, `branch`, `attachment`"
            arg4="◉ task: **<ase-task-id/>**"></expand>

        Set <changeset-type><value-type/></changeset-type> and
        <changeset-name><value-name/></changeset-name>.

    2.  <if condition="<getopt-option-worktree/> is not empty and <changeset-type/> is not `worktree`">
        The context worktree serves the `worktree` changeset only, so a
        `branch:` or `attachment:` changeset would leave it unused (e.g.
        on a mistyped option). Only output the following <template/> and
        then immediately *STOP* processing the entire current skill,
        leaving the working copy *untouched*:

        <template>
        ⧉ **ASE**: ◉ task: **<ase-task-id/>**, ▶ ERROR: option `--worktree` requires a `worktree` changeset (got **<task-changeset/>**)
        </template>
        </if>

        Otherwise, prepare the context worktree:

        <expand name="changeset-context"
            arg1="<getopt-option-worktree/>"
            arg2="◉ task: **<ase-task-id/>**"
            arg3="false"
            arg4="false"></expand>

    3.  Set <task-target/> to <getopt-option-target/> if it is not
        empty, otherwise to the value of the `Target:` frontmatter key of
        <task-content/>, or to the configured default
        <ase-project-task-default-target/> if the key is absent, and parse
        it:

        <expand name="changeset-value"
            arg1="Target"
            arg2="<task-target/>"
            arg3="`worktree`, `branch`, `source`"
            arg4="◉ task: **<ase-task-id/>**"></expand>

        Set <target-type><value-type/></target-type> and
        <target-name><value-name/></target-name>. If <target-type/> is
        `source`, the target is whatever the `Source:` frontmatter key of
        <task-content/> refers to (or the configured default
        <ase-project-task-default-source/> if the key is absent):
        set <task-target/> to this value and parse it:

        <expand name="changeset-value"
            arg1="Source"
            arg2="<task-target/>"
            arg3="`worktree`, `branch`"
            arg4="◉ task: **<ase-task-id/>**"></expand>

        Set <target-type><value-type/></target-type> and
        <target-name><value-name/></target-name>.

    4.  Determine the *target branch* <target-branch/>: if <target-type/>
        is `worktree`, capture the output of the command
        `git -C "<origin-dir/>" branch --show-current`, otherwise set it
        to <target-name/>. If <target-branch/> is empty (detached `HEAD`)
        or the command
        `git rev-parse --verify --quiet "refs/heads/<target-branch/>"`
        fails, only output the following <template/> and then
        immediately *STOP* processing the entire current skill:

        <template>
        ⧉ **ASE**: ◉ task: **<ase-task-id/>**, ▶ ERROR: target **<task-target/>** is no existing branch
        </template>

    5.  Determine the *merge source branch* <merge-source/> according to
        <changeset-type/>:

        -   `worktree`: Capture the output of the command
            `git -C "<context-dir/>" branch --show-current` into
            <merge-source/>. If it is empty (detached `HEAD`), only output
            the following <template/> and then immediately *STOP*
            processing the entire current skill:

            <template>
            ⧉ **ASE**: ◉ task: **<ase-task-id/>**, ▶ ERROR: worktree **<context-label/>** has no checked-out branch
            </template>

        -   `branch`: Set <merge-source><changeset-name/></merge-source>.
            If the command
            `git rev-parse --verify --quiet "refs/heads/<merge-source/>"`
            fails, only output the following <template/> and then
            immediately *STOP* processing the entire current skill:

            <template>
            ⧉ **ASE**: ◉ task: **<ase-task-id/>**, ▶ ERROR: changeset branch **<merge-source/>** does not exist
            </template>

        -   `attachment`: The change set is materialized on a *temporary*
            branch at the commit it is based on, so that the merge below
            can resolve any drift of the target semantically.

            1.  <if condition="the backmatter of <task-content/> contains NO attachment block with the `Type` key value `text/x-diff; charset=utf-8; kind="<changeset-name/>"`">
                Only output the following <template/>, directly followed
                by the hint, and then immediately *STOP* processing the
                entire current skill:

                <template>
                ⧉ **ASE**: ◉ task: **<ase-task-id/>**, ▶ ERROR: no change set attachment **<changeset-name/>** exists
                </template>

                <ase-tpl-hint level="minimal">
                Run `/ase-task-implement --changeset <task-changeset/>` first to create the change set attachment.
                </ase-tpl-hint>
                </if>

            2.  <if condition="this attachment block is *stale* according to the plan <format/> (its `Modified` key is absent or older than the `Modified` key of the frontmatter)">
                The change set was created for an *earlier* version of
                the plan, so integrating it would deliver the wrong plan.
                Only output the following <template/>, directly followed
                by the hint, and then immediately *STOP* processing the
                entire current skill, leaving the plan and the artifacts
                *untouched*:

                <template>
                ⧉ **ASE**: ◉ task: **<ase-task-id/>**, ▶ ERROR: change set attachment **<changeset-name/>** is **stale** (older than the plan)
                </template>

                <ase-tpl-hint level="minimal">
                Run `/ase-task-implement --changeset <task-changeset/>` again or remove the attachment.
                </ase-tpl-hint>
                </if>

            3.  <if condition="the `Desc` key of this attachment block carries a `merged <commit/>` value according to the plan <format/>">
                The change set was already *delivered* by an earlier
                integration, so integrating it again would replay it onto
                a target which already contains it. Set <merged-commit/>
                to this <commit/>, only output the following <template/>,
                directly followed by the hint, and then immediately *STOP*
                processing the entire current skill, leaving the plan and
                the artifacts *untouched*:

                <template>
                ⧉ **ASE**: ◉ task: **<ase-task-id/>**, ▶ ERROR: change set attachment **<changeset-name/>** was already integrated (merged **<merged-commit/>**)
                </template>

                <ase-tpl-hint level="minimal">
                Run `/ase-task-implement --changeset <task-changeset/>` to create a new change set or remove the attachment.
                </ase-tpl-hint>
                </if>

            4.  Set <temp-base/> to the commit of the `base <commit/>`
                value of the `Desc:` key of this attachment block. If
                the key is absent or the command
                `git rev-parse --verify --quiet "<temp-base/>^{commit}"`
                fails, set <temp-base><target-branch/></temp-base>
                instead.

            5.  Set <temp-hash/> to the first 8 characters of the output
                of the `ase_mint(type: "sha1", hint:
                "<ase-task-id/>:<changeset-name/>:integrate")` tool of the
                `ase` MCP server, which keeps <temp-id/> *unique* per task
                and attachment. Set <temp-id/> to <ase-task-id/> with all
                characters other than `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `_`, and `-`
                stripped, followed by
                `-<changeset-name/>-integrate-<temp-hash/>`, and set
                <temp-branch>ase-integrate/<temp-id/></temp-branch>.
                Determine <temp-dir/> by calling the `ase_worktree_path(id:
                "<temp-id/>", temp: true, create: true)` tool of the `ase`
                MCP server, which places it into the namespace of the
                *temporary* worktrees, disjoint from all other worktrees.
                You *MUST* *NEVER* assemble this path yourself.

                <if condition="<temp-dir/> exists and is *not* a worktree registered according to `git worktree list --porcelain` whose record carries the line `branch refs/heads/<temp-branch/>`">
                It is *not* owned by this skill, so set
                <temp-dir></temp-dir> (empty) to protect it from any
                removal, only output the following <template/>, and then
                immediately *STOP* processing the entire current skill,
                leaving the task plan *untouched*:

                <template>
                ⧉ **ASE**: ◉ task: **<ase-task-id/>**, ▶ ERROR: directory **<temp-id/>** for attachment **<changeset-name/>** exists, but is no temporary worktree
                </template>
                </if>

                Otherwise, remove any *leftover* of an earlier run which
                stopped before its cleanup by expanding the following, and
                then determine <temp-dir/> once again the same way:

                <expand name="integrate-temp-remove"></expand>

            6.  Create the temporary worktree and branch by running the
                command
                `git worktree add -b "<temp-branch/>" "<temp-dir/>" "<temp-base/>"`
                (taken exactly as given), and apply the `Data` payload of
                the attachment block (with the 4-space indentation
                removed) inside it *verbatim*, e.g. via
                `git -C "<temp-dir/>" apply --3way`, re-applying hunks
                which no longer apply manually. You *MUST* *NEVER* modify
                anything *outside* of <temp-dir/>. Leave the change set
                *uncommitted*, as the merge below commits it. Set
                <merge-source><temp-branch/></merge-source>.

            If any of these sub-steps fails, expand the following:

            <expand name="integrate-temp-remove"></expand>

            Then only output the following <template/> and then
            immediately *STOP* processing the entire current skill,
            leaving the task plan *untouched*:

            <template>
            ⧉ **ASE**: ◉ task: **<ase-task-id/>**, ▶ ERROR: change set attachment **<changeset-name/>** failed to materialize
            </template>

    6.  Check that the change set can be delivered at all. Determine the
        *change set directory* <merge-dir/>: for <changeset-type/>
        `worktree` it is <context-dir/>, for `attachment` it is
        <temp-dir/>, and for `branch` it is the directory of the
        registered worktree in which <merge-source/> is checked out
        according to `git worktree list --porcelain` (or empty if there
        is none). Do not output anything, except for the templates
        below.

        -   <if condition="<merge-source/> is equal <target-branch/> and (<changeset-type/> is not `worktree` or <context-dir/> differs from <origin-dir/>)">
            The change set and the target are the very same branch --
            either in a separate context worktree, so nothing would ever
            reach the origin working copy, or selected as `branch:`
            changeset, so a merge would just commit its uncommitted
            changes in place, which only the `worktree` changeset of the
            origin working copy documents. Expand the following, then only
            output the following <template/>, directly followed by the
            hint, and then immediately *STOP* processing the entire
            current skill, leaving the plan and the artifacts *untouched*:

            <expand name="integrate-temp-remove"></expand>

            <template>
            ⧉ **ASE**: ◉ task: **<ase-task-id/>**, ▶ ERROR: change set and target are the same branch **<target-branch/>**
            </template>

            <ase-tpl-hint level="minimal">
            Use `--target branch:<name>` to select a different target branch.
            </ase-tpl-hint>
            </if>

        -   <elseif condition="the command `git rev-list --count "<target-branch/>..<merge-source/>"` reports `0` and either <merge-dir/> is empty or the command `git -C "<merge-dir/>" status --porcelain` reports no output">
            The change set carries neither commits beyond the target nor
            uncommitted changes, so an integration would report a
            success without delivering anything. Expand the following,
            then only output the following <template/> and then
            immediately *STOP* processing the entire current skill,
            leaving the plan and the artifacts *untouched*:

            <expand name="integrate-temp-remove"></expand>

            <template>
            ⧉ **ASE**: ◉ task: **<ase-task-id/>**, ▶ ERROR: nothing to integrate -- change set **<task-changeset/>** carries no changes beyond target **<target-branch/>**
            </template>
            </elseif>

4.  **Integrate Change Set:**

    1.  <if condition="<getopt-option-stateless/> is not equal `true` and the task lifecycle model <ase-project-task-lifecycle/> defines the state `INTEGRATING` (i.e. `enterprise`)">
        Mark the plan as being integrated: set the `Status:` key of
        <task-content/> to `INTEGRATING` (*creating* the key at its
        position in the key order of the plan <format/> if absent), but
        *only* if `INTEGRATING` is reachable from the current state along
        the transitions of the task lifecycle model -- from `APPROVED`
        or `DEFERRED` (via `APPROVED`), or from `IMPLEMENTED` (via
        `APPROVING` and `APPROVED`, as the explicit integration request
        of the user counts as the approval) -- and persist this
        frontmatter-only change -- without refreshing the `Modified:` key
        -- by calling the `ase_task_save(id: "<ase-task-id/>", text:
        "<task-content/>")` tool of the `ase` MCP server. Do not output
        anything.
        </if>

    2.  Capture the outputs of the commands
        `git rev-parse "refs/heads/<target-branch/>"` and
        `git rev-parse "refs/heads/<target-branch/>^{tree}"` into
        <target-before/> and <target-tree-before/>, the target branch
        and its content *before* the merge. Do not output anything.

    3.  Set <merge-args>--target "<target-branch/>"</merge-args>. If
        <changeset-type/> is `attachment`, or <getopt-option-no-cleanup/>
        is not equal `true`, append ` --cleanup` to <merge-args/>, so the
        merged source branch (and its worktree) is removed afterwards. Then
        merge the change set by invoking the `ase-repo-merge` skill,
        which commits still uncommitted changes of the source branch,
        resolves merge conflicts semantically, and checks that the source
        branch landed:

        <skill name="ase:ase-repo-merge" args="<merge-args/> <merge-source/>" result="merge-result"/>

        Set <merge-verdict/> to the `MERGE VERDICT` reported by the
        `ase-repo-merge` skill in <merge-result/> (`MERGED`,
        `CONFLICT`, or `FAILED`), or to `FAILED` if it reported none.

    4.  <if condition="<merge-verdict/> is `MERGED` and the output of the command `git rev-parse "refs/heads/<target-branch/>^{tree}"` equals <target-tree-before/>">
        The merge succeeded, but the content of the target is unchanged,
        as the change set already landed earlier (e.g. on a repeated
        integration), so nothing was delivered: set
        <merge-verdict>NOOP</merge-verdict>. Capture the output of the
        command `git rev-parse "refs/heads/<target-branch/>"` into
        <target-after/>, and if it differs from <target-before/> and the
        output of the command
        `git rev-parse "refs/heads/<target-branch/>^1"` equals
        <target-before/>, drop the resulting empty merge commit by running
        the command
        `git update-ref "refs/heads/<target-branch/>" "<target-before/>" "<target-after/>"`
        (taken exactly as given), which leaves the index and working tree
        of the target intact, as their content is unchanged. Do not
        output anything.
        </if>

    5.  If <changeset-type/> is `attachment`, expand the following:

        <expand name="integrate-temp-remove"></expand>

    6.  Update the frontmatter and backmatter of <task-content/> as
        follows, but persist them *only* if anything changed:

        -   <if condition="<getopt-option-stateless/> is not equal `true`">
            If <merge-verdict/> is `MERGED`, set the `Status:` key to
            `CLOSED` for the `solo` model (traversing the transition from
            `OPEN`) or to `INTEGRATED` for the `enterprise` model (if it
            was set to `INTEGRATING` in step 1 above). Otherwise, keep
            the `Status:` key for the `solo` model (`OPEN`), and set it
            to `APPROVED` (for <merge-verdict/> `NOOP`) or `DEFERRED`
            (otherwise) for the `enterprise` model (if it was set to
            `INTEGRATING` in step 1 above). The `team` model defines no
            integration states, so its `Status:` key stays *untouched*.
            </if>

        -   <if condition="<changeset-type/> is `attachment` and <merge-verdict/> is `MERGED`">
            The delivered attachment block with the `Type` key value
            `text/x-diff; charset=utf-8; kind="<changeset-name/>"` must
            never be delivered again: if <getopt-option-no-cleanup/> is
            not equal `true`, remove it from the "backmatter". Otherwise,
            keep it, but capture the output of the command
            `git rev-parse "refs/heads/<target-branch/>"` into
            <merged-commit/> and append `, merged <merged-commit/>` to the
            value of its `Desc` key, which marks it as *delivered*
            according to the plan <format/>. Its `Modified` key stays
            *untouched*, as its `Data` payload is not changed.
            </if>

        The `Modified:` key stays *untouched*, as the "body" is not
        changed. Apart from the above, the plan *MUST* stay *exactly* as
        loaded. To persist the plan, call the `ase_task_save(id:
        "<ase-task-id/>", text: "<task-content/>")` tool of the `ase`
        MCP server. This `ase_task_save` MCP tool call is the *only*
        permitted way to persist the plan -- *NEVER* write the plan file
        via `Write`/`Edit` or by executing a shell command. Do not
        output anything in this sub-step.

    7.  <if condition="<merge-verdict/> is `MERGED`">
        Only output the following <template/>:

        <template>
        ⧉ **ASE**: ◉ task: **<ase-task-id/>**, ⇢ changeset: **<task-changeset/>**, ⎇ target: **<target-branch/>**, ▶ status: **plan integrated**
        </template>
        </if>
        <elseif condition="<merge-verdict/> is `NOOP`">
        Only output the following <template/>, directly followed by the
        hint, and then immediately *STOP* processing the entire current
        skill:

        <template>
        ⧉ **ASE**: ◉ task: **<ase-task-id/>**, ⇢ changeset: **<task-changeset/>**, ⎇ target: **<target-branch/>**, ▶ ERROR: nothing integrated -- change set is already contained in target
        </template>

        <ase-tpl-hint level="minimal">
        Run `/ase-task-implement` first to create a new change set, or select a different one via `--changeset`.
        </ase-tpl-hint>
        </elseif>
        <else>
        Only output the following <template/>, directly followed by the
        hint, and then immediately *STOP* processing the entire current
        skill:

        <template>
        ⧉ **ASE**: ◉ task: **<ase-task-id/>**, ⇢ changeset: **<task-changeset/>**, ⎇ target: **<target-branch/>**, ▶ ERROR: integration failed with verdict **<merge-verdict/>**
        </template>

        <ase-tpl-hint level="minimal">
        Resolve the reported problem (e.g. commit or stash uncommitted changes of the target, or check out the target branch in a worktree) and run `/ase-task-integrate` again.
        </ase-tpl-hint>
        </else>

5.  **Decide Next Step:**

    1.  *Determine next step*:

        <expand name="task-next-select"
            arg1="ase-task-integrate"
            arg2="DONE|DELETE">
            Next Step: How would you like to proceed with the plan?
            DONE: Stop processing and PRESERVE task plan.
            DELETE: Stop processing and DELETE the task plan.
        </expand>

    2.  Check the tool <result/> and dispatch accordingly:

        -   If <result/> is `DONE` or `CANCEL`:
            Only output the following <template/> and then *STOP*.

            <template>
            ⧉ **ASE**: ◉ task: **<ase-task-id/>**, ▶ status: **plan integrated -- done**
            </template>

        -   If <result/> is `DELETE`:
            Set <args></args> (empty). Do *not* forward any remaining
            `--next` list tokens, because the `ase:ase-task-delete`
            skill accepts only an optional `[<id>]` argument and no
            `--next` option; remaining tokens are intentionally discarded.
            Only output the following <template/> and then call the
            tool `Skill(skill: "ase:ase-task-delete", args: "<args/>")`
            to invoke the `ase:ase-task-delete` skill in order to
            *delete* the updated plan. Immediately stop processing the
            current skill once the `Skill` tool was used.

            <template>
            ⧉ **ASE**: ◉ task: **<ase-task-id/>**, ▶ status: **plan integrated -- hand-off to delete task**
            </template>
