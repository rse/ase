##  NAME

`ase-task-implement` - Implement a Task Plan

##  SYNOPSIS

`ase-task-implement`
    [`--help`|`-h`]
    [`--next`|`-n` *option*[,...]]
    [*id*]

##  DESCRIPTION

The `ase-task-implement` skill performs the *final implementation* of
a task plan by modifying the corresponding *artifacts* with a complete
*change set*. The plan is loaded and any optional `IMPLEMENTATION DRAFT`
section produced by `ase-task-preflight` is used as a hint - the plain
plan content always overrules the draft.

If the task plan deliberately *omits* the `##  VERIFICATION` section
(as produced by `ase-code-craft`, `ase-code-refactor`,
`ase-code-resolve`, or `ase-task-edit` when invoked with `--dry`),
the entire verification phase is strictly skipped: no build, tests,
linter, type-checker, or program execution is performed once the
source files have been modified.

After implementation, the user is asked whether to preserve or
delete the task plan, unless `--next` pre-selects this choice.

##  OPTIONS

`--next`|`-n` *option*[,...]:
    Automatically answer the user dialog for the next step. *option*
    is a single token or a *comma-separated chronological list* of
    tokens; the *first* token is consumed by this skill, and any
    remaining tokens are *forwarded* (via `--next`) to the downstream
    skill so an entire pipeline can be pre-scripted in one shot.
    Recognized tokens at this skill: `none` (default, interactive
    answer required), `DONE` (preserve task plan and stop), or
    `DELETE` (hand off to `ase-task-delete`).

##  ARGUMENTS

*id*:
    The unique identifier of the task whose plan should be
    implemented. If omitted, the *current* task id is used.

##  EXAMPLES

Implement the current task plan:

```text
❯ /ase-task-implement
```

Implement a specific task and delete the plan when done:

```text
❯ /ase-task-implement --next DELETE hello
```
